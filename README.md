# Module 9A - Build Your First React Component

## Description
This is a React app created using Vite that renders a UserProfile component. The component includes a name, bio, and image styled with inline CSS.

## What I Learned
- How to set up a React project using Vite
- How to write and structure a functional React component
- How to use JSX and inline styles
- How to render a component in App.jsx

## Challenges
I had issues with the profile image and text not showing up, but after inspecting the elements, I discovered that the `<h1>` text was not visible because by default the text was a white color. I fixed it by applying a dark color directly to the heading style and profile image.
